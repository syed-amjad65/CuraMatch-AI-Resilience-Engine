CuraMatch AI: The Global Resilience Engine

> **Tagline:** A Prescriptive Analytics System for Ethical Clinical Trial Matching and Real-Time Pandemic/Disaster Resource Allocation.

## 🌟 Project Status
**Active Development: Phase 2 - Deep Learning Predictor Training**

This project is currently under active development. Consistent commits reflect the iterative process of building and validating a robust, ethical AI system designed for extreme stress testing (like pandemic-level events).

## 💡 The Strategic Problem
The COVID-19 pandemic exposed a critical gap in global infrastructure: the lack of systems that can dynamically switch from optimization (efficiency) to **crisis allocation (survival)**. Current clinical matching systems focus on steady-state operations.

The **CuraMatch AI** system addresses this by integrating a two-pronged solution:

1.  **Ethical Matching:** Using Deep Learning to reduce systemic bias in trial cohort selection.
2.  **Resilience Engine:** A framework that detects catastrophic operational anomalies and instantly deploys a prescribed resource allocation plan.

## ⚙️ Core Technical Components (Keywords for Recruiters)

| Component | Technology / Technique | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Anomaly Alert Mechanism** | **Keras Autoencoder (Deep Learning)** | Trained on normal operations time-series data (e.g., ICU occupancy, staff rates). Triggers an alert when reconstruction error exceeds the crisis threshold. |
| **Prescriptive Allocation** | **Google OR-Tools** (Constraint Programming) | Upon alert, the solver re-optimizes hospital resource deployment (staffing, bed space, ventilators) to **maximize patient survival probability** under severe scarcity constraints. |
| **Bias Mitigation** | **SHAP** (Explainable AI - XAI) | Used to validate and correct demographic and socioeconomic biases introduced during the initial trial matching phase. |
| **Data Foundation** | **Time-Series Simulation** (Pandas/NumPy) | Generation of synthetic longitudinal data to model realistic hospital operational flows and simulate non-linear collapse events. |
